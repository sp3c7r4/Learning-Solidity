Smart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary

The Oracle Problem
Blockchains can't interact with / read data from the centralized world

What is an Oracle?
A blockchain Oracle is any device or entity that connects a deterministic blockchain with off-chain data (i.e. Delivers data to the decentralized blockchain or run external computation )

Hybrid Smart Contracts
on-Chain + off-Chain aggrements

ChainLink
Decentralized Oracle Network
This is a modular decentralized network that can both bring external data and external computations into our smart contract to make sure they're decentralized end-to-end

# The Purpose of Smart Contracts
Exploration of the purpose of smart contracts, their advantages over traditional agreements, and their impact on various industries.

## A Smart Contract is 
An Agreement contract, or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain (No one can alter or breach any of these aggrements)
