# Transaction Fee
This is the amount paid to the block producer for processing the transaction
Transaction Fee = Gas Price * Gas Used

# Gas Price
The cost per unit of gas specified for the transaction, in Ether and Gwei. The higher the gas price the higher chance of getting included in a block.

## Hash: A unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by placing said data into a `hash function`
## Hash Algorithm: This is a function that comutes data into a unique hash
## Mining: This is the process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem [E.g the "problem" was to find a hash that starts with four zeros ]
Nodes get paid for mining blocks

Block: A list of transactions mined together
Genesis Block: The first block in a blockchain [ The previous has points to a hash that never exists ]

## Decentralized: Have no single point of authority [ In the blockchain world majority rules ]
## Nonce: A number used once to find the solution to the blockchain problem [ This is mainly used to define the transaction number for an account/address ]
